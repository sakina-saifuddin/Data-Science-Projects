# Analyzing House Prices in Australia (2016)
This project uses a Melbourne housing dataset (2016) to analyze property sales based on features such as number of rooms, property type, size, year built, suburb, distance from the city, and sale method. A regression model is applied to predict house prices and understand the factors affecting property values.
