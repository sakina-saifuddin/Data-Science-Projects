# Analyzing Global University Rankings (2020–2025)
The CWUR ranks universities worldwide based on education, research, and employability.Since the data is spread across different years, it’s hard to see changes and trends.This project collects and analyzes CWUR data from 2020–2025 & it aims to find trends, identify top-performing countries and universities, and understand which factors influence ranking performance.
## Dataset Information
The dataset used in this project provides information about the university that influences global rankings. It includes the following columns:

| Variable | Description |
| --- | --- |
| World Rank |The university’s global position. |
|University | Name of the institution. |
|Country | The country where the university is located. |
|National Rank | University’s position within its own country. |
|Education Rank | Based on education quality and achievements.. |
|Employability Rank | Based on alumni employment outcomes. |
|Faculty Rank | Based on faculty achievements and awards. |
|Research Rank |  Based on research output and impact. |
|Score | Overall CWUR score based on all factors. |
|Year | The year of ranking data (2020–2025). |

## Objective
The main objectives of this project are to:

- Collect CWUR university ranking data from 2020 to 2025 using web scraping.
- Combine data from all years into one clean and structured dataset.
- Analyze and compare the rankings of universities and countries over time.
- Identify the top-performing universities and countries each year.
- Explore how different factors (education, employability, faculty, research) affect overall rankings.
- Visualize trends and patterns in global higher education.
- Generate insights that highlight changes in university performance worldwide.

## Approach
- Data Collection & Scraping: Collect global university rankings (2020–2025) with key features like Education, Employability, Faculty, Research Rank, Score, Country, and Year.
- Preprocessing: Handle missing values and encode categorical data.
- Modeling: Select features and train regression models to predict scores or ranks.
- Evaluation & Insights: Assess performance (RMSE, R²) and analyze trends and factors affecting rankings.

## Impact
This project provides insights into global higher education trends by analyzing university rankings over time. It helps identify top-performing institutions, understand factors influencing rankings, and supports policymakers, students, and academic institutions in making data-driven decisions to improve education quality and competitiveness.
